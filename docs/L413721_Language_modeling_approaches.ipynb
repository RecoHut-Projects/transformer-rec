    "Language Models (LMs) estimate the probability of different linguistic units: symbols, tokens, token sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see language models in action every day - look at some examples. Usually models in large commercial services are a bit more complicated than the ones we will discuss today, but the idea is the same: if we can estimate probabilities of words/sentences/etc, we can use them in various, sometimes even unexpected, ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "We, humans, already have some feeling of \"probability\" when it comes to natural language. For example, when we talk, usually we understand each other quite well (at least, what's being said). We disambiguate between different options which sound similar without even realizing it!\n",
    "\n",
    "But how a machine is supposed to understand this? A machine needs a language model, which estimates the probabilities of sentences. If a language model is good, it will assign a larger probability to a correct option.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Masked language modeling** is the task of training a model on input (a sentence with some masked tokens) and obtaining the output as the whole sentence with the masked tokens filled. But how and why does it help a model to obtain better results on downstream tasks such as classification? The answer is simple: if the model can do a cloze test (a linguistic test for evaluating language understanding by filling in blanks), then it has a general understanding of the language itself. For other tasks, it has been pretrained (by language modeling) and will perform better."

In this, we randomly mask some items (i.e., replace them with a special token [mask]) in the input sequences, and then predict the ids of those masked items based on their surrounding context. \n",

    "\n",
    "PLM is the idea of capturing bidirectional context by training an autoregressive model on all possible permutation of words in a sentence. Instead of fixed left-right or right-left modeling, XLNET maximizes expected log likelihood over all possible permutations of the sequence. In expectation, each position learns to utilize contextual information from all positions thereby capturing bidirectional context. No [MASK] is needed and input data need not be corrupted."

PLM trains an autoregressive model with various permutations of the tokens in the sentence, so that in the end of all such permutations, we would have learnt x3, given all other words in the sentence. In the above illustration, we can see that the next layer takes as inputs only the tokens preceding x3 in the permutation sequence. This way, autoregression is also achieved."
